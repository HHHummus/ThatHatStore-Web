The hat store is a store with hats. Just hats. The store changes the hats you can buy every season. 
# Examples:
February: Valentine's day hats
March: Saint Patrick's hats
April: Water hats
May: Summer break hats (Best time ever!!!!)

# So, what is this GitHub page for then?
This is the website files. Nothing cool here.
